#  OverView
The goal of this workshop is to learn the fundamentals of data fetching with React. You will build an application that allows us to view a list of contacts and click on a selected contact to gain more details about them. The details should be similar to this: 

While the concept may not seem that hard, this time, the data is coming from an external API. To get it, use the browser's built-in fetch() API to make an HTTP request. The API we will consume in the workshop is linked here: JSONPlaceholderLinks to an external site.. It is a free and open API that is easy to use for projects. We will make requests to the /users endpoint.

There will be a lot of details to pay attention to in this workshop. Read the directions carefully.

If you complete this using pair programming, make sure you switch between Driver and Roles. Practice good technical communication.

There are five tabs below. Complete them to finish the workshop.
